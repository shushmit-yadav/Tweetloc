In Registration Page AsyncTask class, i write tweetApi but there is an error, So i write it "TweetApi" then problem resolved.

When deploying project to server by terminal using command "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14547809/is-it-possible-to-store-listkey-as-property-of-a-entity-in-google-app-engine".in backend name is exact as backend name u give in ur project.

to generate android SHA1 key, first of all we have to redirect to bin folder in java and then paste below command....  

command to find SHA1 Key-  keytool -list -v -keystore c:\users\Shushmit\.android\debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android


Send All contacts in server as a ArrayList.....then run
new asyncaddmember()
mytweetapi.addmembersyn(arraylist mobilenum).execute
backend
arraylist mobile addmembersyn(arraylist mobilenum)
{
	
for each element in arraylist 
check if mobile num exist in registration entity
if exist then add in returning arraylist

return arraylist of existing mobile numbers

//App db solution.....
if we change table structure in local sqlite database then we have to update database version or first uninstall app from phone and then install it. otherwise new table will not create.


}


search based on property 
https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/queries#Datastore_Property_filters
Query.Builder q = Query.newBuilder();
q.addKindBuilder().setName("Person");
q.setFilter(makeFilter(
    "height", PropertyFilter.Operator.GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL, makeValue(minHeight)));

fetch mobile number problem is resolved......
solution....
in code telephonymanager returns garbage value which is invalid. so first i check number is valid or not. if number is not valid then prompt window to input number. and again check input number is valid or not...Now code is working properly.

//for showing contacts in add tab and Invite Tab ......
for this purpose i have used ArrayList.contains() method to check elements of arraylist and show it in saperate tabs succussfully....

//if you are trying to push your backend and it fails again and again......
then first restart your Android Studio and goto Build and clean project. After succussfully clean,build your backend again and then try to push tour backend to server.

//biggest problem.....
do'nt use delete,remove,update type of specific keyword in your backend method name.
